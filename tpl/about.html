		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>I have been programming in PHP since 2002, and as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Abugs.php.net+sjon">me</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Abugs.php.net+%22react+dot%22">my collegues</a>
		 used more advanced features we noticed PHP's behaviour would sometimes change without any reference in the changelog. An example of this was <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=63512">this parse_ini bug</a>,
		 which was an example where we needed to demonstrate the variation of results over time and <i>3v4l.org</i> showed a clear advantage.</p>

		<p>Since 2012 I have provided vanilla PHP binaries that make it simpler to demonstrate issues that would otherwise be harder to reproduce, and cumbersome to compare to
		 previous version. Traffic has steadily been growing as more developers found this site to be a helpful daily tool, as the following sessions-graph shows:

		<h2>Statistics</h2>
		<p>I started in april 2012 and have been adding features ever since. If you like numbers, here are a some from the database:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="versions">Versions</a> (including helpers):	 <b>{print number_format(Basic::$database->q("SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'version';")->fetchColumn());}</b></li>
			<li>Scripts in database:			 <b>{print number_format(Basic::$database->q("SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'input';")->fetchColumn());}</b></li>
			<li>Submissions (new + existing):	 <b>{print number_format(Basic::$database->q("SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'submit';")->fetchColumn());}</b></li>
			<li>Functions called by scripts:	 <b>{print number_format(Basic::$database->q("SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'functionCall';")->fetchColumn());}</b></li>
			<li>Results:						 <b>{print number_format(Basic::$database->q("SELECT SUM(reltuples) FROM pg_class WHERE relname LIKE 'result_%' AND reltype>0;")->fetchColumn());}</b></li>
			<li>Registered users:				 <b>{print number_format(Basic::$database->q("SELECT reltuples FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'user';")->fetchColumn());}</b></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Major changes</h2>
		<p>I have been adding features ever since I started. Here is a list with some major changes I made over the years:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Jan 2020</b> - added a live preview option, which runs php completely in your browser, this was originally launched as a separate REPL</li>
			<li><b>Oct 2019</b> - removed HHVM due to it <a href="https://hhvm.com/blog/2018/12/17/hhvm-3.30.html">ending support for PHP code</a></li>
			<li><b>Dec 2018</b> - introduced a live <abbr title="Read-Eval-Print Loop">repl</abbr> to quickly run oneliners</li>
			<li><b>Oct 2018</b> - when resubmitting existing scripts, previous results will immediately be shown and updated in the background. I also moved all results to PostgreSQL partitioned tables</li>
			<li><b>Aug 2018</b> - after moving the search from indexed operations (based on VLD) to SQL LIKE on raw script source, the entire dataset of indexed VLD opcodes was dropped</li>
			<li><b>Apr 2018</b> - instead of Archlinux, all binaries are now compiled on debian - because it's slower with updates meaning less dependency updates</li>
			<li><b>May 2016</b> - existing scripts now maintain they original date/time (eg. <i>date('Y');</i> always outputs <b>2014</b>). This results in better <a href="/bughunt">/bughunt</a> output</li>
			<li><b>Mar 2016</b> - all binaries were recompiled so I could add the <i>intl</i>, <i>bcmath</i>, <i>gmp</i>, <i>iconv</i>, <i>mcrypt</i> and <i>opcache</i> extensions</li>
			<li><b>Sep 2015</b> - scripts no longer run in all versions by default, plus we also had a minor redesign for our first-ever logo</li>
			<li><b>Apr 2015</b> - new layout, added top-menu which allowed me to introduce links to /last and /search</li>
			<li><b>Nov 2014</b> - unfortunately LRTEditor had a nasty bug I couldn't easily fix, so I switched to Cloud9's ACE</li>
			<li><b>May 2014</b> - added HHVM. This was actually a huge change, the chroot went from ~ 250 MiB to ~ 1.5 GiB due to the number of dependencies. It fortunately turned out to be a popular feature</li>
			<li><b>Aug 2013</b> - replaced CodeMirror with my own <a href="http://sjonhortensius.github.io/LRTEditor/">LRTEditor</a></li>
			<li><b>Jul 2013</b> - moved backend from c+sqlite to go+postgresql</li>
			<li><b>May 2013</b> - added links to manual and php-source-code</li>
			<li><b>Nov 2012</b> - added vld support and better layout, plus I also added the performance overview</li>
			<li><b>Oct 2012</b> - the site got some great exposure, including <a href="https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/258688195158487040">one of my favorite replies</a></li>
			<li><b>Apr 2012</b> - launch</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Pro-tricks</h2>
		<p>There are a few tricks and some hidden functionality you might appreciate:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Did you know you can submit a script using the keyboard shortcut <i>ctrl + enter</i>? The quick-preview can be triggered by using <i>alt + enter</i>.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Want to copy a script to run it yourself? You can simply download it, use:</p>
				<pre>$ curl -H Accept:text/plain https://3v4l.org/uNUDC</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>While there is no official API, you can use REST and get json output for most pages:</p>
				<pre>$ curl -H Accept:application/json https://3v4l.org/uNUDC</pre>

			<li>
				<p>Do you ever use the inline <i class="icon-tasks active"></i> diff functionality? You can select the base of the diff by clicking the 'Output for &lt;version&gt;' header first.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Technology</h2>

		<h3>Backend</h3>
		<p>This site started out on a server with 256 MiB memory, which was enough to run one script at the time, as well as the site itself. However, when I added HHVM,
		 it needed a lot more memory, so I upgraded to a 1 GiB machine. Because of dropping prices, the site current runs on a 4 GiB machine.</p>

		<p>I use a setup where scripts are executed in a small virtual machine. For security reasons this machine has no network and only a minimal filesystem.
		 Scripts are executed by a daemon (written in <a href="http://golang.org/">Golang</a>) and results (with statistics) are reported to
		 a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database. All results are stored and used to provide averages for the performance overview.</p>

		<p>I use the following php.ini settings for the scripts:</p>
		<pre>
[PHP]<br/>
; ini_set should be in here too if you're concerned about security<br/>
disable_functions = pcntl_fork,phpinfo<br/>
max_execution_time = 3<br/>
memory_limit = 64M<br/>
enable_dl = Off<br/>
<br/>
; for consistency of older versions<br/>
allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off<br/>
html_errors = Off<br/>
<br/>
; show all errors by default, if we'd lower this in the script we'll miss some parser notices<br/>
error_reporting = -1<br/>
display_errors = On<br/>
display_startup_errors = On<br/>
log_errors = Off<br/>
report_memleaks = On<br/>
<br/>
[Date]<br/>
date.timezone = Europe/Amsterdam<br/>
		</pre>

		<p>When I started in 2012, this site was nothing more than a small bash script that looped through all available PHP binaries and stored the output in <i>/out/</i>.
		 For fun; here is the source-code of the script that I started with:</p>

		<pre>
#!/bin/bash<br/>
ulimit -f 64 -m 64 -t 2 -u 128<br/>
<br/>
[[ ! -d /out/$1/ ]] &amp;&amp; mkdir /out/$1/ || chmod u+w /out/$1/<br/>
<br/>
for bin in /bin/php-*<br/>
do<br/>
       echo $bin - $1<br/>
       nice -n 15 sudo -u nobody $bin -c /etc/ -q "/in/$1" &amp;&gt;/out/$1/${bin##*-} &amp; PID=$!<br/>
       ( sleep 3.1; kill -9 $PID 2&gt;/dev/null ) &amp;<br/>
       wait $PID<br/>
       ex=$?<br/>
<br/>
       sf=/out/$1/${bin##*-}-exit<br/>
       [[ $ex -eq 0 &amp;&amp; -f $sf ]] &amp;&amp; rm $sf<br/>
       [[ $ex -ne 0 ]] &amp;&amp; echo -n $ex &gt; $sf<br/>
done<br/>
<br/>
chmod u-w /out/$1/
		</pre>

		<p>Because of the amount of files this generated (which did not play well with the average filesystem block-size) I replaced this with a SQLite based database with an inotify-based script that picked up changes in /out/ and imported them into the database.</p>
		<p>For simplified connectivity to the database I replaced this with a C-based binary in 2013; and that was replaced by a Go-based program that's still in use today.</p>

		<h3>Frontend</h3>
		<p>As for the website you are currently looking at, this was originally based on the <a href="https://github.com/SjonHortensius/TooBasic">TooBasic framework</a> I build specifically for <i>3v4l.org</i>. As the number of features increased I eventually migrated to another
		 framework (which is not open-source, but it's called the <i>Basic Framework</i>) with an actual Model and Template-parser.</p>

		<p>For performance reasons I strip the HTML, CSS and javascripts; but there have been a few invisible upgrades here as well. Originally I used <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a>
		 but that has been replaced by <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a>. If you'd like, you can find a <a href="/s/my.js">human-readable version here</a>.

		 My work pays off, as can be seen when <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/#5985afc21f400000">analyzing</a> the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2F3v4l.org%2F">performance of this site</a>.
		</p>

		<p>The layout has taken a few cues from Bootstrap but given the verboseness of both its HTML and CSS I don't actually use that.
		 The initial layout allowed for only the input and output to be visible, which was why I did an update where I added the tabs allowing for various helpers to be included.
		 You're currently looking at the third layout iteration, which was done specifically to allow for some global contextual links to be visible and allow for various other features.</p>

		<h2>Consistent dates and times</h2>
		<p>To get consistent output I try to eliminate as much environmental changes as possible. The chroot is rarely changed, and some methods are overloaded to provide consistent results. For example, <i>php_uname</i> will always return the same output.</p>
		<p>This is to keep the number of unique results down, and make <a href="/bughunt">the bughunt</a> a more useful tool. This fixation is also done on all date/time methods. A run will start at the same time for all versions, even though the actual walltime progresses.</p>
		<p>For example - <a href="/MtDjZ">this simple <i>echo date();</i> script</a> was submitted in 2012. Since it was created, I have executed it on new versions as well - which all output 2012 even though most of the PHP versions weren't even released at at that time!</p>
		<p>The date/time fixation uses the <b>last submit time</b> as reference. This means a quick-preview can sometimes show "outdated" timestamps as you are actually looking at output from a run with the previous submit-time.</p>
